# odin-recipes
Projects done through The Odin Project
This project i combined everything learned in html in one to combine a mock website that links to multiple recipes in this case. The biggest thing this helped me with was the git process (git add, git commit & git push) and got me more comfortable in doing this process when working on a project.
