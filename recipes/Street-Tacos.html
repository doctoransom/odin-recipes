    <p>Al pastor is a Mexican dish with pork that’s been slow roasted on a vertical spit. Vertical spits are
        often associated with middle eastern food and this is no exception. Legend says that Lebanese immigrants
         brought the cooking method to Mexico, where they paired it with traditional adobada to make the genius 
         style known as al pastor.</p>

    <p>It’s served in all kinds of dishes, from tortas/sandwiches, to pizzas, and even on rice, but the most
        celebrated way to serve it is in tacos al pastor. The crisp smoky pork is sliced-to-order with a razor
        sharp knife as it’s flame crisped by the vertical spit. The meat falls right into each taco and topped 
        with a flourish of slow-roasted pineapple. It’s heaven in a tiny tortilla.</p>
    

    <ul> <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>Guajillo Chilies</li>
        <li>Achiote Paste</li>
        <li>Chipotle Chilies in Adobo</li>
        <li>Fresh Pineapple</li>
        <li>Corn or Flour Tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h3>Steps for making Al Pastor Tacos</h3>
        <li>Soak your chiles. Guajillos come dried and soaking them makes them pliable and easy to deseed.</li>
        <li>Slice and season your pork. I try to go for as thin of a slice as possible, so that there’s more 
            surface area to absorb the marinade.</li>
        <li>Make the marinade. Blend the guajillos together with garlic, sugar, achiote, adobo, and pineapple juice until smooth.</li>
        <li>Marinate. Marinate your pork for at least 30 minutes, but better yet, overnight.</li>
        <li>Roast. You probably don’t have a vertical spit at home, so the best way to achieve that combination of soft supple insides
             and crispy, smoky edges is to lay out the pork in a single layer and broil at 500ºF until cooked. Don’t forget to roast 
             your pineapples as well (on a separate baking sheet).</li>
        <li>Prep your toppings. Dice your onions, chop your cilantro, slice your jalapenos, and portion out your salsas.</li>
        <li>Chop it up. Roughly chop your pork so that the majority of the pieces are about 1/2″ x 1/2″.</li>
        <li>Crisp up your al pastor. Frying it is optional but really intensifies the flavors, not to mention gets it nice and piping hot.</li>
        <li>Prep your tortillas. If you’re using flour tortillas, you should cook them now. If corn, cover 10-12 at a time with a damp paper 
            towel and microwave for 30 seconds (or use a tortilla warmer like we do).</li>
        <li>Build and enjoy! Top with roast pineapples and all the other toppings you love.</li>
    </ol>
