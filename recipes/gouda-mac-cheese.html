    <h1>Gouda Mac & Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/mc.jpeg">
    <p>Homemade gouda mac n cheese recipe is creamy, extra velvety and swirls
         perfectly around al dente pasta with extra cheese sauce in each crevice
          for pure deliciousness in each forkful.</p>
    <p>This homemade pasta dish actually has 2 kinds of gouda and a surprise cheese too!
          The creamy, smokiness of the gouda combined with the more “tart” goat cheese will
           become a family favorite! (the fact that it takes less than 20 minutes to make is a bonus too!)</p>
    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>Rigatone Pasta</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Smoked Gouda Cheese</li>
        <li>Goat Cheese</li>
        <li>Gorgonzola Cheese</li>
        <li>Dry Mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Cook your pasta in a large pot of water with kosher salt until al dente, then drain pasta and set aside.</li>
        <li>Start with melting your unsalted butter in a pan on medium-heat so it doesn’t burn. Ideally you would like the 
            butter to remain a light color and not brown.  (I like a cast-iron skillet or any large sauce that conducts 
            heat evenly will work.)</li>
        <li>Add all purpose flour and whisk until its completely mixed in. Get all the lumps out.</li>
        <li>Then let the flour cook for 2-3 minutes to bring out the nutty flavor.</li>
        <li>Add whole milk or heavy cream slowly while whisking, Once it thickens add the regular gouda and the smoked gouda 
            cheese and the goat cheese stirring until the cheese melts.</li>
        <li>Add any spices you want in (I use nutmeg, black pepper – if you want it a little zesty you could add a pinch of 
            dry mustard. Although my favorite add in is my homemade cajun seasoning mix.</li>
    </ol>
