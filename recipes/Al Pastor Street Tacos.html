    <hl>Al Pastor Street Tacos</hl>
    <img src="images/alpastortacos.jpg">
    <p>Al pastor is a Mexican dish with pork that’s been slow roasted on a vertical spit. Vertical spits are
        often associated with middle eastern food and this is no exception. Legend says that Lebanese immigrants
         brought the cooking method to Mexico, where they paired it with traditional adobada to make the genius 
         style known as al pastor.</p>

    <p>It’s served in all kinds of dishes, from tortas/sandwiches, to pizzas, and even on rice, but the most
        celebrated way to serve it is in tacos al pastor. The crisp smoky pork is sliced-to-order with a razor
        sharp knife as it’s flame crisped by the vertical spit. The meat falls right into each taco and topped 
        with a flourish of slow-roasted pineapple. It’s heaven in a tiny tortilla.</p>
